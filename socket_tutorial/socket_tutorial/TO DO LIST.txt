// This is a list of things that we still need to get done.
// Feel free to add or delete anything you see fit
// Format preferred would  be: 
	- {Number if it will have a dependency} [dependencies if any] (file name) (function if any) (general description of what needs done)
		Feel free to add a second line -tabbed in with a possible FIX if any

// Client
DONE	- (client.c) (convertDecToHex) (Contains magic numbers)

// Server
- {1}(server.c) (start_server()) (We need to uncomment and debug UDP to make sure it connects properly to UDP)
-	[1](server.c) (start_server()) (Currently one of the threads will be run and it will never join since the second thread is in a wait loop with (accept))
- (server.c) (start_server()) (server has a DEBUG sleep(10000) and will need to be taken out)
DONE	- (server.c) (convertHexToDecimal()) (Contains magic numbers)

// Windows Specific
-

// Linux Specific
- The project still needs to be run in linux for the first time

// General concerns or thoughts
- It might be nice if we move all the specific windows/linux calls into a general function. e.g. 
	=function to start stop watch. Inside this function it can decide if windows or linux is neccesary and call the appropriate one
